Once upon a time, I found a little php script called phpTodo.
I tried improving on it and created phpTödö, it was a disaster and never worked.
In university, for a php class, it was reborn as phpTödö2 and it worked great because of sessions and PDO.
In work training a while back, while learning Laravel, I decided to try making it once more as phpTödö3 and Laravel was fun to make it with.
